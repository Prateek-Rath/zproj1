I want to store attempt history in the context.js in an array and link it to local localStorage
the history array will be like ...(decide later)
When I press finish(/the timer runs out), I have to set the history array's particular attribute called responses

'e' in a response indicates that the question has not been attempted
history : [{your_responses: ['a', 1, 'e'], feedback:{noattempted: x, nounattempted: y, nocorrect: z, noincorrect: a}, quizname:"", numberofattempts:1, date: date()}, {}, {} ...]
